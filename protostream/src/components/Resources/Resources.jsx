            <p>
              Here’s the stark reality – only 50% of the small businesses in the
              survive past their 5th anniversary. Heck, 20% fail in their first
              year.
            </p>
            <p>
              But why am I rubbing all these annoying stats in your face?
              Because I want to emphasize that entrepreneurship without the
              right support is way tougher than you can imagine.

            <p>
              In short, the right support system can become a powerful force in
              growing your business. You can share your struggles,
              entrepreneurial stress, and get answers to your queries in a
              support network. So where can you find such support groups?

              Michelle recommends forums such as EO and YPO. Facebook groups
              like Women Helping Women Entrepreneurs and Societygal - A
              Community for Creative Female Entrepreneurs are also noteworthy
              groups.

              Visualize your business idea in different biz models with Business
              Model Canvas. It’s like dressing your business in different suits

              But don’t get sucked into the business planning trap for too long.
              Our 20-year study found that spending too much time planning and
              organizing the details of your startup correlated with early stage
              venture failure.

              So ditch your perfectionism, keep your business plan simple and
              straightforward, and then dive right into the real work.

            <p>
              Getting an idea from your mind to the market takes tons of work
              and a lot of direction. But it’s easy to get lost in the details,
              which is where a mentor can be the lighthouse that guides you
              ashore.

              Not convinced yet? Even the most successful entrepreneurs like
              Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates had mentors.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The best way forward is to, “find mentors to guide you in specific
              contexts and areas—having just one general mentor is a dated
              approach that doesn’t work as well in today’s business landscape,”
              as Michelle advises.
