            <h3 className="subhead">1. Support groups for entrepreneurs</h3>
            <p>
              Here’s the stark reality – only 50% of the small businesses in the
              survive past their 5th anniversary. Heck, 20% fail in their first
              year.
            </p>
            <p>
              But why am I rubbing all these annoying stats in your face?
              Because I want to emphasize that entrepreneurship without the
              right support is way tougher than you can imagine.
            </p>

            <p>
              In short, the right support system can become a powerful force in
              growing your business. You can share your struggles,
              entrepreneurial stress, and get answers to your queries in a
              support network. So where can you find such support groups?

              Our 20-year study found that spending too much time planning and

            <p>
              Getting an idea from your mind to the market takes tons of work
              and a lot of direction. But it’s easy to get lost in the details,
              which is where a mentor can be the lighthouse that guides you
              ashore.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not convinced yet? Even the most successful entrepreneurs like
              Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates had mentors.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best way forward is to, “find mentors to guide you in specific
              contexts and areas—having just one general mentor is a dated
              approach that doesn’t work as well in today’s business landscape,”
              as Michelle advises.

            <p>
              I like to think of F4S as an adviser that tells my motivations –
              what energizes me at work, potential talents, and possible blind
              spots that need attention. Let me explain this a bit: F4S uses
              science to measure 48 of your unique motivations at work, making
              it a perfect entrepreneurial resource.
            </p>

            <p>
              Research at F4S reveals that successful entrepreneurs have the
              following traits:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>High levels of initiation to take action.</li>
              <li>
                Higher focus on money and the financial aspects of business.
              </li>
              <li>Higher focus on big picture thinking.</li>
              <li>Low focus on structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In minutes, F4S tells you how high you rank on these and other
              critical attitudes for entrepreneurs. Knowing this helps you bring
              awareness to any blind spots, or hire someone with complementary
              motivations to take on the work you don’t like.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides, learning your motivations is a good way to understand
              whether you’re better suited to be a business builder or an
              entrepreneur, and even if a certain business idea suits you or
              not.
            </p>

            <p>
              Plus, F4S will help you out as you bring together a high
              performing team of individuals with diverse motivations to
              complement each other perfectly.

              were stressed. Another 34% said that they were “worried all the
              time.” That’s over almost 80% of entrepreneurs sharing a common
